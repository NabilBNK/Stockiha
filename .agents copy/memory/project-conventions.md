# Project Conventions

## Git Workflow
- Always create a new dedicated branch for major code changes.
- Branch name format should follow: `feature/[task-slug]` or `fix/[bug-slug]`.

## Supported AI platforms (AG Kit)
- AG Kit **only supports Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity**.
- Do not claim compatibility with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, or other assistants unless the user explicitly expands scope.
- Copy on the website, docs, FAQ, README, and marketing should describe AG Kit as a toolkit for Gemini CLI / Antigravity-style agent setups.

## Manual Testing & App Compilation Protocol
- After completing any new code changes, bug fixes, or slice verifications, ensure `run-app.bat` is ready for manual compilation and launch.
- Always provide a clear, step-by-step manual testing guide to the user, including test accounts, credentials, and verification steps.
